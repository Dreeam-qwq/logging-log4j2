= 2.x.x

This release primarily contains bug fixes and minor enhancements.

The Log4j 2.20.1 API, as well as many core components, maintains binary compatibility with previous releases.

Apache Log4j 2.20.1 requires a minimum of Java 11 to build and Java 8 to run.
Log4j 2.12.4 is the last release to support Java 7.
Log4j 2.3.2 is the last release to support Java 6.
Java 6 and Java 7 are no longer supported by the Log4j team.

For complete information on Apache Log4j 2, including instructions on how to submit bug reports, patches, or suggestions for improvement, see http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/[the Apache Log4j 2 website].
